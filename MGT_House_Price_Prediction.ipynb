        "The \"House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques\" is a machine learning competition that challenges participants to develop models that accurately predict the sale price of residential homes based on various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. The dataset used in this competition contains 79 explanatory variables describing (almost) every aspect of residential homes in Ames, Iowa.\n",
        "\n",
        "The goal of the competition is to create a regression model with the lowest root-mean-squared-error (RMSE) between the predicted and actual sale prices. Participants are required to use the provided training dataset to develop a model that can accurately predict the sale prices of homes in the testing dataset.\n",
        "\n",
        "To successfully tackle this problem, I will analyze the features provided in the dataset, understanding their meanings, and identifying any missing or incomplete data. I will also need to investigate the relationships between the different features and their correlations with the sale prices. By doing this, I can gain insights into which features are most important in predicting the sale prices and develop a strategy for feature engineering and selection."

Linear models assume that there is a linear relationship between the input features and the output variable. If the true relationship is more complex than this, a linear model may not be able to capture all of the nuances of the data. Therefore, by using feature engineering, and manualy creating new features, linear models can often be improved to capture more complex patterns in the data."
